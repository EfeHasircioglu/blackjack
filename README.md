# Blackjack

This is a standard game of blackjack. Although it has issues, it is mostly playable, and it is also my first project with Svelte!

## Issues

- Double down logic does not correctly work, when we get the only card we can, it should directly draw results no matter what but sometimes it just stays.
- Funky in & out animations for dealer's cards.
