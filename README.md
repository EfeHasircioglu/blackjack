# Blackjack

This is a standard game of blackjack. Although it has issues, it is mostly playable, and it is also my first project with Svelte!

## Improvements to make

- Changing the place of the status indicator to between the dealer cards and the player cards.
- Adding neat, satisfying sound effects.
- Making the game feel a bit more.. lively?

## Known bugs

- Sometimes, for an unknown reason, the game comes to a standstill.
- Sometimes, also for an unknown reason, the player only recieves one card.
